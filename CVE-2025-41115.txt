1. Vulnerability Explana

© CWE-266 1134271
2Aa07.

CVE-2025-41115 pertains to a security flaw in Grafana's SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
provisioning feature present in Grafana versions 12.x. Specifically, if the feature is enabled and configured
improperly, a malicious or compromised SCIM client can exploit the system by providing a specially crafted
“externalid” , which is a numeric identifier used during user provisioning.

This malicious input allows an attacker to override internal user IDs within Grafana, effectively hijacking user
profiles, impersonating legitimate users, or elevating privileges. In essence, the attacker can manipulate user November 21, 2025 at 2:38 PM EST

identities and potentially gain unauthorized access or escalate their permissions within the system:

2. Impact & Significance

- Scope: A network-based attack that does not require privileges or user interaction.
- Severity: CRITICAL, with a CVSS score of 10.0.

- Impact:
- Confident High — unauthorized access to user data

- Integrity: High — ability to impersonate or alter user identities.

- Availability: High — potential to disrupt user services or administration functions

3. Technical Det

## How the Vulnerability Works
- The vulnerability is rooted in the handling of the “externalId” parameter during SCIM provisioning.
- When an attacker supplies a numeric “externalZd’ , the backend improperly associates it with internal user

IDs.

- The flaw includes insufficient validation of the “externalid” , leading to potential overrides in user identity

mappings.

-lf “enableScIM” and “user_syne_enabled* are enabled in the configuration, the system is vulnerable to this

attack,

### Underlying Cause Track CVEs Effortlessly

- Inadequate validation routines for the “externalId” field in the SCIM implementation

- Lack of sanity checks on input during the provisioning process.

- Possible default or inconsistent handling of user identifiers, allowing external “externalId* values to influence
internal user ID mappings.

5. Mitigation & Recommendations

## Immediate Mitigation
- Disable SCIM provisioning until patches are applied

> “plaintext
[auth. seim]
enablescIM = false
user_sync_enabled = false
- Review and audit all SCIM client integrations to ensure they are from trusted and verified
sources.
### Configuration Controls
- If SCIM must be enabled, disable or restrict the ~ externalid’ attribute validation or processing.
- Implement network restrictions: limit SCIM client IP addresses where feasible.
- Set strict access control policies and monitor logs for suspicious provisioning activity.
### Patching & Updates
- Apply the latest security patches issued by Grafana for version 12.x or upgrade to a supported, more
secure version.
- Ensure that the upgrade process is tested in a staging environment before deploying to production.
### Additional Steps
- Regularly review user provisioning logs for anomalies.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts,
- Conduct periodic security audits focused on identity management workflows

6. Additional Context & Related Vulnera

- Related Vulnerabilities: Similar identity handling flaws or injection vulnerabilities in user provisioning
systems are common in other platforms. Cross-reference CVE-2024-XXXX or CVE-2023-XXXX for comparable
issues

- Security Advisories: Regularly check Grafana security advisories for new updates or related issues.

- Best Practices:

- Use principle of least privilege in SCIM integration.

- Document and verify all external identity sources

- Conduct periodic, comprehensive security assessments of identity management features.

Summary

CVE-2025-41115 exposes a critical flaw in Grafana's user provisioning system via SCIM, enabling attackers to
potentially hijack user identities or escalate privileges remotely and without user interaction. Immediate action
should include disabling the vulnerable feature, applying patches or upgrades, and reinforcing identity validation
controls
